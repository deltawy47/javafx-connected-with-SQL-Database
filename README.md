you will find the report and the sql code  at main branch

javafx desktop application connected with mysql database (for Databases CSE333 PROJECT ) fall2022

some constrains : we made the methods work on specfied tables (not all) to save time... so:

1- in adding tubles (films,drama film,action film ,comedy film, crew ,producer,actor,director) //may be there is more working tables I cant remember

2- in editing/deleting tubles (films,drama film,action film ,comedy film, crew ,producer,actor,director,rate) //may be there is more working tables I cant remember

3- in view (films,user)

4- in statemnt problems (1,2,3and 4)

note : we had an error at viewing on tableview so we were viewing tables at (CONSOLE)

note2 :there is alot of unused files in the src code (from an old project(reuseability ma maan)) so dont get confused i will draw you map later for the used files

I hope this will help to get your project started :)
